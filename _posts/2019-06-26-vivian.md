Today I spent most of the day preparing for the open house and working a bit more on the CS Chat slides.

This morning I finished preparing the parts of the CS chat slides up to our progress so far. As we continue working, I will continue updating these slides. I also got in touch with Brian Hilton who volunteered to meet with us about ArcGIS Insights. We have a meeting set up for Monsay at 2:30pm.

I also made a copy of the CS Chat slides and changed them up little by condensing and changing the content so it is appropriate for Friday's open house.

The rest of the afternoon was spent decorating the office, which will be continued tomorrow.
