Today, I worked with the ArcGIS software and explored how it works.I had requested and then received an account with ArcGIS under the Claremont Library Organization. This allows me to create the standard maps and work with the developer portion of ArcGIS that is normally locked behind a payment wall or a 7-day free trial. Although the website is fairly confusing and not as intuitive as it could be, by getting familiar with it and exploring the various features, I will be learning how to create a map that Sustainable Claremont requested. Luckily, ArcGIS has various resources and forms that help developers work with their API. Developing tools to create a map that can be applicable to the needs of Sustainable Claremont might be easy once I can figure out how the website works. Likewise, by being part of the library, I now have access to the various tutorials on the ArcGIS website. Next week, I will be spending my time working and understanding ArcGIS through the tutorials provided.
