================

Today, I spent the day working on ArcGIS Online, worked with ArcGIS Insights, created my slides on CS Chat, and also created a basic template for an updated website page for the mapping of trees.

I was not able to fix the problems with ArcGIS Online that I will be talking about with Brian on Tuesday. As such, I took screenshots of what I currently have as well and embedded what I currently have into my portion of slides, website, and insights. For insights, I worked with understanding how the graphs work with one another. Since it provides an interactive interface that you can relate separate layers with one another in real time, I believe it would be helpful to understand how Insights works. Using these graphs, I tried embedding them, the maps, and the old youtube video that last year had into my presentation slides as well as the website, however there seemed to be an issue when embedding anything. None of the maps and video loaded for some reason, so I did screenshots for the slides and kept a section empty for the website.

Since I do not have a map with accurate data for ArcGIS Insights yet, I just made some temporary experimental data tables with relationships that do not necessary represent what we want. With this, I was able to produce the following interactable map thatâ€™s related to the interactable graph at the bottom of this post. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with Brian to see if my methods are viable and continue working from there. If they are not viable or is too hard to finish by Thursday, then our solutions to the map/spreadsheet problem will be as Brian originally recommended. Those maps will then be used for the final product.
