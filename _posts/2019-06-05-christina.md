I am both pleased and confused by our meeting with Nicole today. On one hand, I am glad she likes the features we have implemented, but on the other, I am not sure how to proceed. We did get new tasks to work on, yet I am wary because they deal with a part of the past summer’s work that I am wholly unfamiliar with: the shade study. Anyways, let’s start at the beginning…

In the morning, I came in and finished up ensuring that my unsubscription function worked perfectly. I cleaned up the spreadsheet for a demo, adding useful test data, and made sure that our changes had been published to the Green Crew website. I also went through and commented all of the code as suggested by Professor Medero. I cleaned it up in terms of adding semicolons where ones were forgotten and ensuring that brackets were at the correct indentation levels for proper understanding. At this point, I felt as if there wasn’t much more to do before our meeting: We had satisfied most of Nicole’s requests, and the code and spreadsheet was clean and working. Now, we just needed to come up with a game plan to make our meeting efficient, ensuring that we get our questions answered, and get feedback on what we have done and clear direction on what still needs to be done. 

Nicole seemed happy with what we had done; our new features operated in a similar fashion to the old features, so the changes didn’t seem too drastic at all. She was also receptive of our reformatting of the spreadsheet to include more data. We had brought with us a summarized list that we had made of what we had accomplished, as something to guide the meeting and also act as a record for Nicole to keep in case she wants a record of what we have done. We included our ideas and questions at the bottom on this list, and it was very helpful because it made sure that we did not forget anything important. Of these questions, we got answers for most of them, however, Nicole did not yet have the information we needed about the relationship between precipitation frequency and temperature to provide us enough insight to complete our precipInForecast() function to further inform weatherContent(). She said that she will get in touch with the city arborist, who is the source of knowledge like this. After answering our questions, she presented more ideas for the project. My notes from this part of the conversation are transcribed below:

* New shade study (Talk to Medero!)
* Submit Tree Problems
* Message from Tree on Map
* Images
* Pictures on Map
* Benefits on Map
* Individual Tree Benefits
* Automate Tree Facts
		
Going back from the meeting, I immediately got started automating the tree facts, as it was something that I knew was immediately doable based on similar work I had done with transferring data between sheets in subscribing/unsubscribing automatically. I will continue this tomorrow, as well as begin to look into how to package up our product and how it could best be distributed.
