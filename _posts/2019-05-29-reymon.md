Today, we were able to finish the automated messaging system to include translated messages in the top 20 most common languages in the US. 

Throughout the day, we struggled with the syntax of Javascript to create a clear block of code that could produce the results we wanted. Although Google Translate is not the most accurate when it comes to translating, compared to manual translation, we have added the feature to allow for translated messages if requested. By the end of the day we were able to fully accomplish todayâ€™s goal.  Despite the new feature adding new and exciting things, a small issue that may arise that will require further fixing is that Google Translate also translates street addresses. Tomorrow, we will attempt to apply what we have learned today and apply it to include Zip codes for another source of accuracy for different cities.
