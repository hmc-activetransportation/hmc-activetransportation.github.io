Today, I worked on ArcGIS Insights. Throughout the day, the graphs that I produced became increasingly complex.Some of the graphs that I produced were able to show clear relationships between data, such as tree direction with tree distance being compared to CO2 Sequestered in lbs, however when I reviewed the data tables, the data was being imported in a strange way. 
Originally, the data being imported was initially just, Species, Longitude, Latitude, CO2 Removed in 40 Years (in equivalent gallons of gasoline), CO2 Saved in 40 Years ($), Rainfall Intercepted in 40 Years (gal), Ozone Removed in 40 Years (lbs), Canopy Radius Growth Rate (ft), Date, and Project. Since one idea we wanted to present with the graphs was planting suggestions, I was told to add the tree distance and tree direction. However, this presented various problems when it came to importing/formatting the data. When merging the data, the data was being merged requires a unique identifier for the data to be merged properly. Since the data sheet that we were originally using was the one for the maps that included redundant information to allow for time, the data was copied for each similar identifier. This produced over 20,000 rows of data. Originally with the first data set, the data could be filtered by the year and produce the actual numbers, however with this merger, it became impossible to filter out anything. As such, an easy solution would be to create yet another spreadsheet that contains all the data that we want to be formatted in the way we want. One thing I’m currently confused about is how Insight relationships work between data tables within itself. I think I am creating relationships within the imported data in a correct way when I create any graph, however I may just be confusing the terms or the creation of relationships between data is not easily discernible. The standard method in creating a relationship is selecting two separate data tables and merging them to create a relationship based on a unique identifier. In the end, there still are issues with the data because a lot of the data is missing for the relationships we want. For example, we only have about 80 tree direction and distances compared to the 800 trees. If I wanted to fix the data for the single ReLeaf project, I would be manufacturing the results to show a fake correlation that may be different every time if I were to randomize the missing inputs. Likewise, the conference posters are basically done and I don’t believe we will be adding any of the graphs from Insight other than perhaps the species column chart.
