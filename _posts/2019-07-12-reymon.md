Today mainly consisted of working with ArcGIS Insights. In the morning, I switched the source of my graphs to a csv file of the spreadsheet we are using. Originally, the graphs were attached to the ArcGIS map that only contained the Releaf 1.0 and CalFire Projects. Hopefully with the switch, fewer problems arise with data formatting. However, to update the graphs and maps, someone would need to do both separately to see changes rather than just on the maps. I am currently working on seeing whether or not the graphs can be modified in other aspects. There is an option to create a relationship between graphs to create another graph, however I am not sure what data is being presented since the graph become auto-generated. 

Throughout the morning/afternoon, I attended the College Chat over the topic of Art and attended Alina’s presentation for her last day. The College Chat was very interesting as it’s purpose was to question what can be considered art and to promote our creative endeavours. Likewise, Alina did an excellent job presenting and it was wonderful to see that she had learned a great deal in the span of a few weeks.
