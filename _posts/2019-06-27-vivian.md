Today we spent most of the day decorating the office and finishing up the slides.
At this point the slides are essentially done with the slides, although we might run through them a couple times tomorrow morning before the open house to ensure that our presentation goes smoothly.
This morning we also had a meeting with Gabriela from Community Engagement to talk about what to do in case we encounter any uncomfortable situations during the fourtn of july event. I feel better prepared and more comfortable with reaching out to a volunteer at the Sustainable Claremont stand if there is a uncomfartable situation.
For our office decorations we have gone for a Lorax-drake-texting-trees theme. We've decided to merge with the Texting Analysis group as one team, since our decorations started overlapping.
Tomorrow we will finish up preparing for the open house, then the open house will occur at 11. We also have a meeting with Jeanine at 2:00 to talk about ArcGIS.
