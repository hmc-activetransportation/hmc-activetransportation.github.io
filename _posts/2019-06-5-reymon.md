================

After scheduling a meeting with Nicole from Sustainable Claremont, we have discussed the various changes/improvements we have made and received positive feedback. For the most part, we will be keeping all the changes we have added while also further improving their functionality. For example, the language translation does have a few functional issues when translating important information such as addresses, however we will be solving that problem by implementing a method of seeing the original message. With all the forms we have added, I have added a general feedback and concerns form that will address any issues or concerns over a residents tree. With this additional form, we will have 4 forms on the website: feedback for the watering reminders and the two forms for subscribing and unsubscribing. Tomorrow, I will be working on automating the Tree Facts into the messaging system as requested by Sustainable Claremont.
