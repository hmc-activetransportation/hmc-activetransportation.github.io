Today, I have worked on the automation of tree facts into the messaging system. Throughout the day, my partner and I had competed in developing a fully functioning function that obtains a fact from a separate spreadsheet, updated by Sustainable Claremont manually, and adds it to the body of a message. Throughout the challenge, I faced various issues such as obtaining data from another spreadsheet and updating dates in that spreadsheet. My method of implementation relied on cyclical selection of facts and repeated once every fact was used once. Since my partnerâ€™s code was the first to be fully functional, which relies on standard randomization in obtaining facts rather than my cyclical, we will be using that code for the final implementation. Tomorrow, I will continue to modify and improve current code.
