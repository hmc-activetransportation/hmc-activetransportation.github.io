Today, I worked on figuring out various different maps and exploring the resources the previous groups used.

The code for static maps was only supposed to be used “for reports and quick visualization of the trees” according to the Protocol from the previous team. As such, if that function is still needed for reports then it can be easily modified to incorporate further improvements. For now, the maps on the website are fine as they are since they just provide a nice visual of all the trees for each project. The only necessary thing for the embedded maps to be updated and recreated is to reformat addresses and update all the information for trees so that it can be clearly seen after being clicked on. Currently, some map markers do not provide any relevant information and sometimes do not provide any tree data. Some street addresses are formatted in a strange way causing the map markers to be placed outside of Claremont and occasionally in streets like those in New York (e.g. 11th st/E). Although, Sustainable Claremont requested for individual tree data to also be incorporated into the maps embedded into the website, updating with live information cannot be added into Google My Maps. However, a simple solution would be to run and simulate each individual result for each tree and add it only once into the spreadsheet as an “Estimate of Tree Benefits.” After all the additional information is added, then the Google My Maps can be recreated and then embedded once more. That would be one solution to have a “dynamic” map on the website. I would have to contact Sustainable Claremont with more details regarding what they are requesting out of the map system.

There is a website called OpenTreeMap that contains a database of all the trees that are in Claremont. For the first planting project, ReLeaf 1.0, most of the trees are accurately portrayed with tree information and claimed to be planted in the ReLeaf project; they even include pictures of the trees during the time of planting. Despite this, most of the information is incomplete or very basic. After ReLeaf 1.0, other projects only contain the tree name and do not contain tree information or a nice picture. I do not know if Sustainable Claremont is still updating information on the website or if they have moved on to other programs. Despite this, perhaps the website can be used for our automations in some way. I will further explore these possibilities tomorrow.
