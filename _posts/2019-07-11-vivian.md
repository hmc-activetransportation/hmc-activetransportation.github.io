Today I spent the morning preparing for our CS chat and I spent the afternoon working on the ArcGIS map.

This morning I continued preparing my slides and a few back up slides for our presentation as well as running thrugh my slides a few times. I think that the presentation went fairly well and I got to talk about my backup slides and show the updated version of the map that I finished that morning.

At 1:30 we met with Brian from the ArcGIS lab to talk about the maps we have been working on. It seems like the method that Christina and I have been working on is the most feasible method for making the maps, so we will proceed with this method. 

We spent the afternoon running the ArcGIS analysis on the rest of the trees and starting the process of making the new maps for each project. Although one concern that I brought up during our meeting with Brian is that the data does not update as the google spreadsheet updates. This is something I will look into tomorrow to see if I can fix. If not, we may have to write a user guide for how to update the map.
Tomorrow I plan to finish making the maps for the rest of the projects using our newly processed data, then look into how we might embed the map into the Green Crew website.
