Today I worked on understanding how the tree distance and tree directions affect the benefit calculations using ArcGIS Insights and our tree benefit data. Likewise, I tried to explore and search for a couple of examples of some of the problem trees we have that display some of the strange calculations. 

Throughout the day, I tried to compile and compare all the data for the ReLeaf Project that seemed strange. At first, I began to search for any problem trees that contain strange numbers. Seeing that there are numerous trees with varying data, I began to look into comparing the variables that are affecting the data calculations. For my first test, I tested the tree distance variable with every other variable being the same. For that first test, it seemed that the close distance and the far distance had the same results while the middle distance had a much smaller result. In my second test, I wanted to test distance again with another sample while also introducing direction. With this test, it seemed like distance does not affect the calculations at all even though it should based on the first test. This test now introduced the idea that distance doesnâ€™t matter but direction does. With my third test, the distances were all the same but the directions were different. In this test, all the results were the same. The direction had no effect on the values of this calculation. The first picture contains my notes on the problem trees and first set of tests. Since all three tests began to show very contradicting information between distance and direction, I began another set of tests that would tests every tree within each distance at different directions.

In the next set of analysis, I began grouping every direction within the 3 different distances and began grouping the information. From the tests, I gathered that the directions such as North, West, and NorthWest seem to be the mostly normal and are roughly in the same range every time. For example, West Direction seems consistent and around the overall average, nether too high or too small. Any variation that includes East or South, such as NorthEast and SouthEast or just East and South, seem to have the most variability within them. Those are the problem directions. The second picture on the bottom contains some of my notes of the second set of tests with the Tree Distances and Directions.
