Today, I continued to work with the network portion of the i-Tree source code. Although I was able to find how each page requested various different portions of the code, I was not able to pinpoint where the calculations are taking place. I was able to find the function where the data is being requested to be processed and calculated however I was not able to find the mathematical portion of the calculations. I believe i-Tree has a separate document or database that contains all the tree codes/benefits that we canâ€™t access and only request from. I believe that it may be possible to directly access the calculation database but that is beyond me. Having an understanding of Jquery and Adobe Coldfusion alongside xml requests would definitely be helpful. 

After meeting with Sustainable Claremont, the maps that they are requesting involve the Shade Canopy study. They are requesting a map that incorporates the growing canopies on each individual tree for every tree that they have planted, which will number around 1000. Previously, the canopies were only applied to the first project which was about 130 trees. As such, the previous group used the ArcGIS software to produce a map with the growing canopies. I will soon be contacting the person the previous team mentions that helped them understand the software and obtain the resources that last year had. Tomorrow, I will be exploring the ArcGIS software.
