Today, we spent the morning preparing for the open house and we spent the afternoon being introduced to ArcGIS.

This morning we finished up the decorations and condensed the slides a bit more, then at 11 the open house started. It was fun and interesting to explain the project to community members, and we got some interesting insight into potential directions we could take this project (ex: connecting to sprinkler systems, moisture sensors, etc.)

This afternoon we went to meet with Jeanine about ArcGIS about how to use ArcGIS Online to make our shade canopy. I found this tutorial very helpful and it has simplified the ArcGIS Online tool a lot. 
This afternoon Alina and I also started working on the spreadsheet analysis portion of the project. We talked about what Alina learned in Codeacademy and introduced for-loops and arrays in order to start writing the spreadsheet Analysis tool.

Next week I plan to continue helping Alina write her spreadsheet analysis tool. I think that after we finish the first tool it will be easier for her to write other tools more independently and with more freedom. I also plan to look more into what Jeanine was talking about with ArcGIS StoryMaps. We have an additional meeting with Brian Monday afternoon to discuss ArcGIS Insights, which, although is part of ArcGIS Pro and not ArcGIS Online, I think will we useful to see what tools are available in ArcGIS Pro in order to keep our options open and in case ArcGIS Online is not sufficient.
