================

Today I continued to work with the verification of our data in our ArcGIS related spreadsheets.

One initial confusion of iTree that was made completely clear to me today is that “Distance” and “Direction” do not affect CO2 Sequestered lbs and $ or Rainfall Intercepted. They affect any column with the term “avoided” and affect the electricity portion of benefits. As such, CO2 Sequestered, in lbs or $, and Rainfall Intercepted are only affected by species, not by direction and distance. This was initially confusing for the fact that the data that we had seem to display that distance and direction did have an influence on those numbers. However, it seems that the issue was that the crossed out trees in the ReLeaf Project portion were creating a bigger issue than we had initially thought. For the ArcGIS map sheets, it seems that the crossed out trees provide a blank placeholder for the next trees data to be inserted causing an upward shift of data. This causes a couple of issues, however it seems to correct it self throughout the ReLeaf trees. At numerous points, the pattern seemed to stop and fix itself and sometimes it followed a completely different pattern of errors. By the end of the project, it corrects itself and the issue does not follow into the next portions. As a result, this issue of incorrect data only occurs in the ReLeaf portion and every tree following that project are correct. *When I was initially looking in the morning was that the growth rate seem to be correct for all trees species so that was correct since it was independent of the benefits.

Although we began to modify and update code, and some of the data is being corrected, I have provided my notes on the patterns that I initially observed on the ArcGIS Input Sheet. This can be useful for me as we modify the code and if the pattern still arises after tomorrow.

For ArcGIS, this resolves some of the initial issues I had with inconsistent data being displayed. For now, if one wanted to see patterns in the data at this moment, I believe if the ReLeaf Project were to temporarily be filtered out, not deleted, the data would show consistent and logical patterns. Once the problem is resolved, the graphs can finally be created without any confusing and misleading information.
