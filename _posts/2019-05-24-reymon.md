Hello, me again! Today was very productive! We had a meeting with Green Crew and addressed our future goals. One main concern they had was to incorporate whether it will be raining each reminder week. We were able to accomplish that today and successfully solve issues with the weatherInfo function. We developed 2 new functions that are able to return whether or not it will be drizzling, raining, or snowing as well as how many days those conditions will occur. As such, using this information, we will modify a function that determines the frequency of watering trees, based on temperature, to also include the precipitation. After solving the problem of processing weather data for precipitation, we have begun editing the Green Crew website and incorporated a demo-survey that can be used to have new subscribers to the email/text list. Next time, we will either be working on the automated text messages to incorporate the frequency of watering based on precipitation or further editing the website.
