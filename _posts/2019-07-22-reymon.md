Today, I worked on the verification of the data that we are receiving from i-Tree and displaying.

In reference to the 3 groups of Crapemyrtle Trees with similar variables but varying distances.  The website calculations matches the data in the two ‘Benefit Results’ sheet we have. However, in the ArcGIS Input, and therefore the Output sheets, the data that is being transferred over is not the same as the other two sources. In ArcGIS Input the CO2 Removed is 34.0835 lbs over 40 years, which appears to be very close to the latitude coordinates, while in the other two sources the CO2 Removed is 681.67 lbs over 40 years. 

Another aspect, is that for the majority of trees of the same species, the distance should not be a major component in calculating the CO2 Sequestered or Rain Intercepted. Likewise, the distance seems to be more of a component in the avoided aspect of the calculations and not the sequestered aspect. At first, I believed that perhaps the data that was not exact but in the range was being calculated as avoided + sequestered however that does not seem to be the case for any tree. One proof is that since the same species of tree should be returning the same amount of CO2 sequestered while the avoided could largely be different, our data would not contain so many similar numbers. Numerous different species seem to contain the same numbers for all the benefits even if they are completely different. Although that’s not specifically the problem since different species might actually be producing similar benefits, at the moment, I believe that any tree that contains the number “34.0835”  or “2.5795” as their CO2 Sequestered in 40 Years should be investigated. Even though the CO2 Sequestered ($) in 40 years is accurate, the lbs is incorrect. Likewise, some of the larger numbers seem to not be accurate as well. As a result, this may be one of the reasons that there are strange patterns on the graphs being demonstrated in ArcGIS Insights.

For trees numbered 44-47, I have provided two screenshots of the different data being displayed. The only commonality they have is the CO2 Sequestered in $ is accururate for one tree, but none of the CO2 Sequestered in lbs is accurate. This is also displayed in other trees where the $ amounts is accurate but the lbs is not. * On the benefit list, Tree #46 was crossed out which is why is was not added on the individual benefit sheet, however when adding the tree data to the map, the tree benefits is still shown to be displaying the issue mentioned above.
