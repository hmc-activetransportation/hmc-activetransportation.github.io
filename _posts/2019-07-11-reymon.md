================

Today, we had our CS Chat at 11:30 as well as a meeting with Brian in the afternoon at 1:30. I spent the morning preparing and going over my slides as well as shortening any slide that needed to be shortened. Our CS Chat went fairly well.

Before going to the meeting, I discovered that ArcGIS Online is very inconsistent when creating layers with buffers. After having made 5 different maps, each testing different steps of my theory, I saw that it sometimes transferred all the data fields, which I wanted, when creating one buffer layer but didn’t transfer anything other times, even if the process was exactly the same. Likewise, I saw that although my first map that contained all the data fields within a buffer had date fields with time settings, the new map which had the same data (+3 more date columns) was not able to recognize the dates and therefore considered the fields as strings. This caused the map to not allow the option for time settings even though the data was available. For the afternoon meeting with Brian, I came to the conclusion that although my theory of creating a map consisting of a merged or overlaid layer of buffers is technically possible, as long as everything decides to work, it would be best to use the method that Brian initially presented. After the meeting, I worked on ArcGIS Insights and created several graphs that are very fun and interesting to look at. Some issues that might arise, or I may just missed something, is formatting the graphs to our decided preferences. For some of the graphs, I was not able to change the x-axis or y-axis directly. For example, the intervals are not clear enough as they are and I would like to make them smaller. For the bubble chart, for some reason it is not possible to change the colors of the bubbles. I’m not sure why, but hopefully I find out how. Otherwise, the graphs are customizable to a certain degree. Although there are some inconsistencies due to the formatting of data that cause some issues with Insights, for the future, it should be to big of a problem when all the data is imported and updated. As such, I will continue working on Insights tomorrow.
