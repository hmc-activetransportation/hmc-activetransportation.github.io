================

* What I accomplish today:
    * I expanded the messaging system 
       * We started to incorporate individual preferences to the time of notification.
       * We began to incorporate individual needs such as having notifications in other languages, e.g. Spanish.
    * We modified the website to include easier subscribing and unsubscribing methods. 
       * The Google Survey to subscribe was changed to contain possible future needs such as language, time preference, and location.
       * We added a Google Survey that will be used to help manage unsubscribing individuals.
       * Google surveys will be used for facilitate and promote an easier indirect form of feedback that is not a direct call or text message
    
* A problem we ran into today:
    * The previous team's code appears to be very rigid when it comes to including new information on the existing spreadsheet. For example, the columns are referenced in a confusing manner in Google Sheets and do not have left-over room to allow for expansion at the moment. 

* Plan for tomorrow:

We will be exploring how to change variables and functions referencing the columns without breaking anything.
