================

Today, we worked on the tree benefits code and worked once more on figuring out how maps work. It appears the numbers we are getting from the tree benefit code appear to be inaccurate. We will be working to fix that. In regards to the maps and other concerns, I have contacted Sustainable Claremont once more to see what they want out of the maps and if the maps on their new site is what they originally wanted. The site has already been created but not published/easily found. I think a link from Sustainable Claremont’s main page into the Green Crew page we created would solve that issue once we are ready for the traffic.

For dynamic maps, the previous group proposed several solutions however the only viable solution would be either to keep using Google My Maps and have someone manually update a new map once a new project is completed or switch to using Google Maps and have everything automated and modified. The group proposed Google Forms however that won’t necessarily be useful for Google Maps since we don’t want any new data from the maps to be recorded. Likewise, the previous group proposed Fusion Tables however Google will be discontinuing that in December 2019. 

Next week, we will be discussing with Sustainable Claremont if we have successfully accomplished what they requested.
