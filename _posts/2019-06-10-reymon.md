Today, I have begun to explore and understand the code for the Analysis Tool for Tree Benefits. The code is not as clear as the code for the messaging system and contains lots of commented out portions of code. For one section of code, an additional yet necessary feature for the organization is commented out due to various errors. Currently, I am struggling to understand the code and how it functions. One reason might be that since the code was originally adapted from Python Code and converted to javascript in Google App Script, the original logic used during that stage of development no longer worked when it was converted to Google AppScript. Likewise, the code is functional however it is very lengthy. There are about 900 lines of code that can be condensed using either a dictionary or another method. Tomorrow, I will begin to work on solving the issues of runtime and fixing the map function.
