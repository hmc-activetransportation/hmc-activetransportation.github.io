Today I worked with Alina on finishing up our first spreadsheet analysis tool as well as having a meeting with Brian Hilton about ArcGIS.

This morning I spent some time looking at potential ArcGIS maps that will work for our purposes. I think that a potential form that might work as an embedded map is having one embedded part on the website with multiple interactive maps (almost like slides) that the user could click through. I think that this would work for if we had one 'slide' for each planting project (ex: one for Releaf 1.0, one for Solis City, etc.). Another potential form that could work is just having one large interactive map with all the projects, but this may be too overwhelming and messy since we have over 800 trees.

I spent the rest of the morning working with Alina on finishing up our first spreadsheet tool. We now have code that can analyze the directions of the trees planted. This works for the most part, but there are some special cases, like when the trees are crossed out or when the direction is N/A that we still need to deal with.
Next we need figure out how to implement a chart to automatically pop up as a visual representation of the data being analyzed.
Tomorrow we will finish debugging the spreadsheet analysis tool with Alina, implement the chart pop ups, and continue working with ArcGIS. We also may need to start practicing for next week's presentation.
