Today, I spent my time researching Feature Collections for ArcGIS Online. Today as I was looking into the difference of the data that was imported to create the layers that I desired, I was able to find that the one that worked was considered a Feature Collection. By this, I learned that regular hosted layers do not technically contain data within them, but rather empty fields that get filled by the map. It makes sense since ArcGIS allows other people to use your layers so your data fields would get populated with their data. For Feature Collection layers, all the data is permanently contained within the layer and is always transferred over when being used on other maps. Although the solution seems apparent, I found tutorials and documentation of that Feature Collection layers exist, can be used, and what they are for, but I was not able to find how they are made. I am able to create them by saving the layers directly as individual independent layers from the maps. However when the layers are created in this method, they are not populated with the transferred data and are not yet considered feature collections until after I save them. Tomorrow, after our CS Chat, we will be meeting with Brian at 1 p.m. Hopefully he can provide a solution. 

Attached below is a slide of our presentation of the progress we have made from last year's shade canopy that used ArcGIS Desktop compared to our ArcGIS Online map.
