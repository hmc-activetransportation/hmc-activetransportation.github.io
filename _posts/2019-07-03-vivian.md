Today I worked with ArcGIS and tried to get the time slider to work.

I spent the vast majority of today working with the ArcGIS map tools to try and get the time slider to appear. I reached out to Brian Hilton a few times and I think I am much closer to getting the time slider to work for our purposes. Throughout today's exploration I found that it is necessary to add the data table as an item and then as a layer instead of adding it directly to the map as a layer. This is necessary in order for ArcGIS to read in the dates and to enable the time settings necessary for a slider. The only problem is that with this method of time slider, we will be using the redundant rows. This might work, since Christina is working on a spreadhseet format where we have individual spreadsheets for each time interval.

Tomorrow I will continue trying to find the optimal way to create a time slider for our tree data. I also may start introducing dictionaries and for each loops to Alina if she feels comfortable with her slides bby tomorrow.
