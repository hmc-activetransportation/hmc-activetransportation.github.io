================

Today, we have accomplished the task of applying what we learned yesterday and applied it to include zip codes. Initially, we struggled with the organization and management of the many dictionaries we planned to create. We thought that each dictionary would feed of of each other in a long string of functions that would apply the weather condition data for each zip code. In the end, we managed to minimize the amount of dictionaries and condensed everything into our initial functions without having to go through our initial difficult plan. 

As a result, we have integrated the messaging function to obtain different weather conditions based on the location of the resident and if desired, translated to another language using Google Translate. It is now possible to send a watering reminder anywhere in the world. :earth_americas:

Tomorrow, we will work on extending the messaging system to include various different variations of zip codes, e.g. those outside the US, expanding the phone number system, and begin the implementation of the time preferences of the reminder. 

**Successfully implemented:**
- [x] `Zip Codes`
- [x] `Language Translation`
- [ ] `Future Goals`
