Today, I worked on ArcGIS Online. I had scheduled a meeting today with Brain however I believe his meeting went over time or he had forgotten about our meeting since he was not at his office. I have sent another email requesting a meeting tomorrow so hopefully that works. Update: meeting will be on Thursday after our CS Chat which is a sham. Either way, I had worked on the maps today and am still facing the same issues as before. I am wondering what caused that spreadsheet data to be transferred through the buffers the first time and not every other try I did. For that, I will keep trying new things. One belief is that after the first successful try, I added the time interval columns. Perhaps ArcGIS has a maximum capacity for time intervals, which would seem strange although it could be a reason why the time slider doesnâ€™t work with multiple intervals for each row in the first place. Another is that perhaps the format of the data that we have somehow conflicts with ArcGIS? As I was experimenting with the data and the tools, it seems like I was getting different results. For example, on ArcGIS Insights, the graphs were not correctly correlating with each other and the data tables were not working. Tomorrow I will continue working with ArcGIS.
