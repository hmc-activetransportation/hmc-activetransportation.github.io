Today, we have accomplished the various goals that we had established yesterday. The messaging function now includes expanded utility for zip codes as well the implementation of time preferences such as morning, afternoon, and evening. One problem I encountered while searching how Googleâ€™s translation service function is that it may be difficult to incorporate sentences that should not be translated while keeping it simple for the person creating the messages. A solution to the entire message being translation while keeping important information the same involves the writer of the message to input various symbols into the original message that may feel confusing and that reduces the readability of their draft.

For next week, we are awaiting for feedback over the various changes/improvements and to correct any small discrepancies, such as the frequencies of watering, as well as the few website changes. We will continue to further work on improvement on the current code while also planning on future goals that we can begin working on.
