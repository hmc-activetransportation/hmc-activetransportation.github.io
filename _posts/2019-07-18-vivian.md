Today I worked on finishing up some fun facts, looking more into the permissions on ArcGIS, and condensing the poster.

This morning I finished ccalculating some fun facts (For example: Over 25 years, the ReLeaf 1.0 project alone will have:
removed an amount of CO2 from the air equivalent to 23,854 gallons of gas, saved an amount of electricity equivalent to leaving 100 lightbulbs on for 2 years continuously, saved an amount of electricity equivalent to the amount of electricity 10 houses use in a year).
I have sent these fun facts over to Nicole in case she wants to use them or in case she would like more similar facts.

I also looked more into how to transfer editing permissions from my account to someone else's account. I could not find any conclusive way to do this so I ended up emailing Warren and asking for his help on how to transfer ownership or give editing access to others.

Christina and I also worked on condensing the poster information into bullets for most of the afternoon.

Tomorrow, I might practice presenting the poster and finding other fun facts.
