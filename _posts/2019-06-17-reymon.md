================

Today, we welcomed a new person to the Green Crew team. We introduced the high-schooler to the various projects we are currently working with and helped them get settled in for their first day. We faced a lot of problems concerning whether or not the results we are getting for the tree benefits are accurate, however we agreed that for now they are fine until we can discuss the results with Sustainable Claremont. We are currently awaiting for Sustainable Claremont to schedule a day to discuss the several small changes we are planning to make and any concerns they may have. I personally worked on reviewing and looking over the code for any quick bug fixes while I await for the feedback for maps. Something I am interested in but does not fully align with App Scripts and Sustainable Claremont's request are GUIs. If publishing our code through Google does not work out, then creating a GUI would help facilitate another form of using the application, under the condition that it isnâ€™t hard to connect a GUI code to App Scripts code. Tomorrow, hopefully will be our meeting with Sustainable Claremont that will decide on whether Google Maps is necessary, whether or not the tree data analysis is correct, and whether or not we should start working on the Shade Canopy Study.
