Today, I spent my time working on trying to fix the issue of getting runtime errors with a large amount of data being selected as well as understanding the issues of static and dynamic maps. This year, Google App Scripts updated their Map API to require an API key and require the project to enable billing for usage limits. As a result of this, I believe we are now unable to obtain and produce an automatically updating static map of the trees planted using Google Maps API unless Sustainable Claremont decides to pay for an API Key. Whether or not this additional feature is to be added for Sustainable Claremont, the addition of the maps in the code re-introduces the issues of making it general for other organizations to use. This issue will have to be resolved later when we are making everything general enough for distribution. 

In other news, we are having trouble understanding how the code for i-Tree works. There are issues with the data to call the species of trees as they are not on the list for i-Tree. If the tree is not on the list, then a standard tree would be used as a substitute to prevent the code from breaking. This may explain why results can be similar and not actually representative occasionally. 

Tomorrow, I will be working on the code for the tree data that is used in i-Tree.
