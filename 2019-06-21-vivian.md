Today involved finishing up the default values for the Tree Benefit Analysis tool and taking steps to start working on the newer parts of the project.

This morning I was able to implement the default values as Nicole suggested. Where we initially had the default direction as North, we now have a randomly chosen direction if the user doesn't input a direction, which was accomplished through a short (two line) helper function. Where we initially had the default distance as 20'-40', we now have a weighted spread of 0% "0-20ft", 60% "20-40ft", and 30% "40-60ft". Nicole also mentioned that if the tree is located at a park, median etc then choose the farthest distance option, but I could not find a way to get the code to recognize if a tree is in a park or median just based on the adress of its location, so instead I updated the drop down menu to have an option for "park or median" so that if the user chooses this option, it corresponds to the furthest distance. I checked with Nicole to see if this seemed like a viable solution, and it seems that she is satisfied with this solution. This was accomplished through another helper function as I could not find a way to use the same direction helper function, because of the weighting of the distances, whereas directions are completely random. 
Regarding the default value for the tree species, in general it seems like the tree species is always filled out for every tree that they plant, so I don't think that a case of unspecified tree species is something we need to worry too much about. Currently, I have left the default tree species as a Crapemyrtle, since it will give the best underestimae, but if this is insufficient we can write some code to get the most common tree on the spreadsheet and use that as the default. At this point, it seems that the coding portion of the Tree Benefit Analysis Tool is complete.

This morning we also attended the open house for the Engineering Research students which had me starting to think about our open house next week. We spent some brief time this morning talking about ways we might decorate the office with tree branches or using the budget we have to go to a craft store to find supplies. I also started thinking about the best way to display what we have accomplished so far. Maybe we could make a poster for the background information about Green Crew and Sustainable Claremont, then we could show how our tool works live to the people that show up.

Today, we also sent out an email to try and set up a Library research tutorial for how to use ARCGIS, but so far there is no response. Hopefully, we will receive a response soon so that we can start using ARCGIS and we can start working on the map portion of the project.

This afternoon I started working on the slides for our CS chat the week after July 4th. This has mostly been writing up some background information about our goals and about Green Crew and Sustainable Claremont's goals. I anticipate that a lot will change between now and our CS chat in over a week, but for now I think that coming up with background slides and slides about the goals of this project will be productive. I also may start to write about the Contact and messaging tool since it seems to be mostly done. The Tree Benefit Analysis Tool may need a little more polishing, but I think that by Monday or Tuesday I will be able to write about those tools as well. Although it is a little early to start worrying about the CS chat, I think that taking these steps could be helpful in seeing what we want to present during the open house. This laying out of what we have accomplished so far and what we want to do next could also be helpful in thinking about what topic I might want to look into if we have extra time.
On Monday, I plan to continue working on the slides for the CS chat and maybe think a little bit more about what we are doing for the open house.
